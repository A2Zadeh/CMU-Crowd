# CMU-Crowd
CMU-Crowd is a Human Intelligence Task (HIT) platform that is fully customisable for specialized tasks. Built on Django and Bootstrap, it streamlines the process of building large datasets and setting up an in-house annotation system.
It may be used as a complete solution by simply providing HTML templates for jobs and using example templates that come with it, or serve as a starting point for dealing with different levels of worker authentication,
tracking worker statistics and launching tasks easily.
